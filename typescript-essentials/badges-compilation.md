## Reflections

1. **Getting started with TypeScript**: JavaScript is one of the most popular web development languages. However, developing modern, fairly complex applications means the need to manage and maintain a huge amount of code. In such situations, JavaScript's capabilities are limited. And TypeScript allows you to eliminate these limitations by, for example, typing.
2. **Declaring Variable Types in TypeScript**: Static typing helps to better document code and also allows you to detect errors that do not match the expected type.
3. **Implementing Interfaces in TypeScript**: Interfaces and type definitions allow you to document the structure of objects, accompanied by type checking.
4. **Developing Typed Functions Using TypeScript**: Because in JavaScript, the number of function arguments can differ from the parameters, and it is possible to pass arguments of any type, the result may not always be obvious and sometimes even unexpected. Using the types of a function's parameters as well as its return values ​​makes debugging easier. And autofill is a nice bonus.
5. **Declaring classes and instantiating them in TypeScript**: Classes, along with interfaces and type declarations, allow you to describe the structure of objects, as well as implement OOP during development. TypeScript also provides the ability to check the presence of properties, methods and their types.
6. **Defining Generics in TypeScript**: Generics allow you to enhance code reuse by dynamically inferring type using templates along with static typing and type checking. Cool instrument.
7. **Accessing External Libraries from TypeScript**: Organizing your code using modules allows you to organize your code according to certain criteria. When using external APIs, TypeScript allows you to define the structure of the input data for further use, which reduces the need to refer to documentation.
8. **Organize your code using TypeScript namespaces**: Using namespaces is similar to using modules: it also allows you to structure your code. And also, thanks to retrieving code from the global namespace, it is convenient for distributed development. Using modules is preferable.

  
Overall, TypeScript greatly simplifies the development and debugging of code.
